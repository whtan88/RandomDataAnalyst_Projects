        "The Monty Hall problem is a famous brainteaser named after a game show host, Monty Hall. It highlights an interesting counterintuitive concept in probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you're on a game show and presented with three doors: behind one is a shiny new car, and behind the other two are goats (let's say consolation prizes). You get to choose one door, but then Monty, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door revealing a goat. Here's the twist: he **always** reveals a goat, but not the one you chose. Now, Monty offers you a chance to switch your selection to the remaining unopened door.\n",
        "\n",
        "The question is: Should you stick with your original choice or switch doors?\n",
        "Most people intuitively think that both doors have an equal chance (50/50) of hiding the car since one goat has been revealed. But that's not quite true!\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's why switching doors is the better strategy:\n",
        "Initially, your chosen door has a 1/3 chance of hiding the car, and the two remaining doors combined have a 2/3 chance (since there are two goats).\n",
        "When Monty reveals a goat behind one of the unchosen doors, he eliminates that possibility but doesn't affect the probability behind your original door (it remains 1/3).\n",
        "\n",
        "Crucially, the probability of the car being behind the remaining unopened door **increases to 2/3** because it now holds all the remaining chance (1- the probability behind your chosen door).\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, switching doors gives you a **double the chance** of winning the car compared to sticking with your original choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of the probabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Sticking with your original choice:** 1/3 chance of winning the car.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Switching doors:** 2/3 chance of winning the car.\n",
        "\n",
        "This problem can be surprising because it goes against our intuition of equal chances behind the remaining doors. But by considering the initial probabilities and how Monty's action affects them, we see the advantage of switching."

        "The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. It is named after Monty Hall, the original host of the television game show \"Let's Make a Deal.\" Here's how the problem is typically presented:\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Setup**: Imagine you're on a game show and given a choice of three doors: behind one door is a car (a prize), and behind the other two doors are goats (not the prize). You pick one door, say Door 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Twist**: Before the door you chose is opened, the host, who knows what is behind each door, opens one of the other two doors, say Door 3, to reveal a goat.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Decision**: You're then given a choice: stick with your original pick (Door 1) or switch to the other unopened door (Door 2).\n",
        "**The Question**: Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\n",
        "**Solution**:\n",
        "To solve the problem, consider the probabilities involved:\n",
        "\n",
        "Initially, the probability of the car being behind each door is 1/3.\n",
        "You pick one door (for instance, Door 1), which has a 1/3 chance of containing the car and a 2/3 chance that the car is behind one of the other two doors (Door 2 or Door 3).\n",
        "\n",
        "The host then opens a door (say, Door 3) which does not have the car. This part is key: the host always knows what's behind the doors and will always open a door to reveal a goat, effectively giving you information about where the car isn't.\n",
        "\n",
        "After Door 3 is opened to reveal a goat, here's what we know:\n",
        "\n",
        "There was initially a 1/3 chance the car was behind Door 1 (your original choice).\n",
        "There was a 2/3 chance the car was behind Doors 2 or 3. Since the host opened Door 3 to reveal a goat, if the car was not behind Door 1, it must be behind Door 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "This means, after seeing the goat behind Door 3, the probability that the car is behind Door 2 (the door you did not originally pick) is now 2/3. The probability that the car is behind Door 1 (your original choice) remains 1/3.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion**: You should switch to Door 2. By switching, you have a 2/3 chance of winning the car, compared to a 1/3 chance if you stick with your original choice. Switching doors doubles your chances of winning the car, based on the probabilities revealed by the host's action of opening one of the other doors to show a goat."

        "Imagine you're a contestant on a game show, and you're presented with three doors. Behind one door is a brand new car, while the other two doors have goats behind them. You don't know which door has the car and which doors have the goats.\n",

        "*The question is:* Should you stick with your original door or switch to the other door?\n",
        "\n",
        "The solution:\n",
        "Intuitively, it might seem like it doesn't matter whether you stick or switch, as there are two doors left, and each has a 50% chance of having the car. However, this is where the problem gets interesting.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key to solving the Monty Hall problem is to understand that the game show host, Monty Hall, has knowledge that you don't. He knows which door has the car and which doors have the goats. When he opens one of the other two doors, he's not randomly selecting a door; he's deliberately showing you a goat.\n",
        "Given this information, the probability of the car being behind each door changes. When you first choose a door, there's a 1/3 chance that the car is behind that door and a 2/3 chance that the car is behind one of the other two doors.\n",
        "\n",
        "When Monty Hall opens one of the other two doors and shows you a goat, the probability that the car is behind your original door remains 1/3, but the probability that the car is behind the other unopened door is now 2/3.\n",
        "So, what should you do?\n",
        "\n",
        "To maximize your chances of winning the car, you should *switch doors*. By switching, you effectively merge the 2/3 probability of the car being behind one of the other two doors into a single door, giving you a 2/3 chance of winning the car.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you stick with your original door, you'll only have a 1/3 chance of winning.\n",
        "\n",
